## 📚 How to Use This Roadmap

- Start with [01 - Fundamentals](01%20-%20Fundamentals.md) and **do not rush**. These concepts appear everywhere.
- After fundamentals, move to [02 - RDBMS](02%20-%20RDBMS.md) and [03 - NoSQL](03%20-%20NoSQL.md) to understand trade-offs.
- Use [06 - Internals](06%20-%20Internals.md) and [08 - Modern Databases](08%20-%20Modern%20Databases.md) once you’re comfortable with basics.
- Revisit [07 - Data Modeling](07%20-%20Data%20Modeling.md) often – good modeling is what separates juniors from seniors.

When in doubt, come back to this page as your **home base**.
