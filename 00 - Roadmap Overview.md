## 📚 How to Use This Roadmap

- Start with [[01 - Fundamentals]] and **do not rush**. These concepts appear everywhere.
- After fundamentals, move to [[02 - RDBMS]] and [[03 - NoSQL]] to understand trade-offs.
- Use [[06 - Internals]] and [[08 - Modern Databases]] once you’re comfortable with basics.
- Revisit [[07 - Data Modeling]] often – good modeling is what separates juniors from seniors.

When in doubt, come back to this page as your **home base**.
