# 02 – Relational Databases (RDBMS)

Relational databases are the **backbone of most critical systems**. This module makes you fluent in concepts and key engines.

---

## 📌 Overview

- [ ] Understand the **relational model** and SQL
- [ ] Learn how major RDBMS engines differ
- [ ] Be able to design and query relational schemas confidently

---

## 🧱 Core Concepts

### [[Concepts]]

- [ ] Understand **tables, rows, columns**, and **relations**
- [ ] Learn **keys**: primary, foreign, composite, candidate
- [ ] Know **normal forms** (1NF, 2NF, 3NF, BCNF) and when to denormalize
- [ ] Differentiate between **OLTP** and **OLAP** workloads

---

## 🛠 Major Engines

### [[PostgreSQL]]

- [ ] Install and connect to a PostgreSQL instance
- [ ] Create tables, define constraints, and write basic to advanced SQL queries
- [ ] Explore **indexes, views, materialized views**, and **extensions**

### [[MySQL]]

- [ ] Understand MySQL’s role in **web and startup ecosystems**
- [ ] Learn differences between **InnoDB** and **MyISAM** (and why InnoDB is default)
- [ ] Practice indexing and query tuning basics

### [[Oracle]]

- [ ] Understand where Oracle is typically used (large enterprises)
