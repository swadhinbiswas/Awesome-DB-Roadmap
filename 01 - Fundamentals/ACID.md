# ACID

Core properties that make transactions reliable.

## 🎯 Goals

- [ ] Define each ACID component
- [ ] Recognize ACID in real-world workflows

## 📚 Checklist

- [ ] **Atomicity** – operations in a transaction are all-or-nothing
- [ ] **Consistency** – every committed transaction leaves DB in a valid state
- [ ] **Isolation** – concurrent transactions don’t interfere incorrectly
- [ ] **Durability** – once committed, data survives crashes
